        It was the first day of school and a new student named Martinez,
        the son of a Mexican restaurateur, entered the fourth grade.
        The teacher said, "Let's begin by reviewing some American history.
        Who said "Give me Liberty, or give me Death?" She saw a sea of blank
        faces, except for Martinez, who had his hand up. "Patrick Henry, 1775."
        "Very good! Who said 'Government of the people, by the people, for the
        people, shall not perish from the earth'"? Again, no response except
        from Martinez: "Abraham Lincoln, 1863.", said Martinez. The teacher
        snapped at the class, "Class, you should be ashamed. Martinez,
        who is new to our country, knows more about its history than you do."
        She heard a loud whisper: "Screw the Mexicans." "Who said that?" she demanded.
        Martinez put his hand up. "Jim Bowie, 1836." At that point, a student in the
        back said, "I'm gonna puke." The teacher glares and asks "All right! Now,
        who said that?" Again, Martinez says, "George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister,
        1991." Now furious, another student yells, "Oh yeah? Suck this!" Martinez jumps out
        of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, "Bill Clinton, to Monica
        Lewinsky, 1997!" Now with almost a mob hysteria someone said, "You little shit.
        If you say anything else, I'll kill you." Martinez frantically yells at the top of
        his voice, "Gary Condit to Chandra Levy 2001." The teacher fainted. And as the
        class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, "Oh shit, we're in
        BIG trouble!" Martinez said, "Saddam Hussein 2003."
